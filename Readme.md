DB Updating Table Dev Challenge
===============================

This module contains a development challenge for DB recruitment.

The instructions are in the site/index.html file.

To view them, run

```
npm install
npm start
```

from within this directory.  This will start a development server (using webpack)
that supports hot reloading but also provides a stomp/ws endpoint providing fake
fx updates.

Once you've started the development server, navigate to http://localhost:8011
to read the task description and get started.

Contemplation:
1. We could use Socket.js as it is more apt for this particular scenario.
2. Any design framework like Bootstrap etc. would have saved time for design implementation.
3. Usage of React or angular could have saved lines of code and also easier approach.
