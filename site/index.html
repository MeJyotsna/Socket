            that you have run the development server by going into the
            db-updating-table directory and run it by running
            <code>npm start</code>

          <li>
            that there were no errors during the development server starting
            (e.g. perhaps port 8011 was taken)
          </li>

            that you are accessing it through that dev server, at
            <a href="http://localhost:8011">http://localhost:8011</a> and that
            no errors are appearing in your browsers console.
